# Heart Disease prediction Using Machine Learning ans Data Analytics approch

Heart disease prediction using machine learning and data analytics involves analyzing medical data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart conditions. In this approach, patient data—such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health metrics—are used to train models that can predict the likelihood of heart disease.

Common techniques include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, often combined with data preprocessing, feature selection, and cross-validation. This predictive modeling helps in early diagnosis and risk assessment, potentially improving patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning, healthcare providers can gain insights that support better decision-making and personalized treatment.
